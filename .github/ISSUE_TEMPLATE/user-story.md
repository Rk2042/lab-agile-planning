As a lab technician I need a digital inventory management system So that I can easily track and locate laboratory supplies, saving time and improving efficiency.
Details and Assumptions:
The lab currently uses a manual inventory system with spreadsheets to track supplies. The new system should integrate with barcode scanning technology and be accessible from both desktop and mobile devices. It should also allow for easy categorization of supplies and provide real-time updates on stock levels.
Acceptance Criteria:
Given the lab technician scans a barcode for a specific supply
When the system updates the inventory count and location
Then the technician can verify the accuracy of the inventory in real-time
